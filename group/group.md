#### Information for prospective students
I typically advise one PhD student per year and several Master's students per year. Students interested in working with me should apply directly to the PhD or Master's programs in [Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/) or [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/academics/graduate-programs/), and feel free to reach out to me to discuss potential research directions or any other questions once you are accepted to your program. Unfortunately I am usually not able to respond to emails from prospective students who have not yet been accepted to our programs.
